# Behavioural Questions

## 1. What attracted you to our startup?

I'm impressed with Growtrics because it is an AI EdTech startup, a field I already have prior experience in. Growtrics' focus on personalized video generation, learning path optimization, and automated grading and feedback aligns well with my background in building AI chatbot systems for education, creating AI-generated lecture videos, and developing scalable cloud-based AI solutions. I have also built NLP and AI tools specifically for Vietnamese users, so I understand the linguistic, cultural, and local needs required to deliver a truly relevant learning experience.

The startup environment excites me as well. I'm comfortable working at a fast pace and taking on multiple roles, from developing AI features to optimizing the company's data pipelines. I also value the opportunity to work closely with the founder and a small, driven team where decisions are made quickly and executed immediately. Having achieved awards in both national and international competitions, I believe I am well-suited to the company's environment and its ambitions.

To sum up, what motivates me most is the mission, improving learning effectiveness through AI. Education is an area where technology can create a lasting and meaningful impact, and I want to join a team that shares this vision to help build that future.

## 2. Where do you see yourself 5 years from now?

In the next five years, my goal is to become a Senior AI Engineer or Technical Lead, leading the design and development of AI systems to solve complex business challenges. Specifically, I want to deepen my expertise in LLMs, personalized learning systems, and scalable cloud infrastructure, while mentoring junior engineers. Just as I currently read and synthesize the latest research papers and host seminar sessions to share my knowledge and experience, in the future I aim to guide younger engineers and contribute to open-source AI frameworks. The rapid development of AI means there is always something new to learn, and I want to maintain a leading position in emerging technologies such as advanced prompt engineering and model optimization.

## 3. Why did you leave your previous jobs (if applicable)?

I left my previous roles to seek opportunities where I can work more directly on AI-driven products, take on greater technical challenges, and contribute to a mission I'm passionate about.

## 4. How do you think education can be improved with technology and why?

With my hands-on experience building AI education systems, I believe technology can fundamentally transform education, making it more personalized, accessible, and effective.

- **Removing language and geographical barriers:** My work fine-tuning Vietnamese NLP models has shown that AI can preserve and advance education in local languages while connecting students to global knowledge. In Vietnam and across Southeast Asia, many students struggle with educational content available only in English. AI can translate and adapt content to fit cultural contexts, making quality education truly accessible regardless of geography or language.

- **Creating intelligent content:** Based on my expertise in prompt design and LLM optimization, teachers can generate exercises, explanations, and assessments aligned with specific learning goals. This helps address the large content gaps in specialized subjects and emerging fields such as AI itself.

- **Real-time assessment and feedback:** Unlike traditional tests that are graded weeks later, AI can deliver instant feedback. The chatbot systems I built, with over 50 weekly users, showed that students engage more when they receive immediate, context-aware answers. This creates a continuous learning loop instead of the delayed feedback cycle in traditional education.

However, technology should complement rather than replace human connection. Teachers will act as guides and mentors, while AI handles repetitive tasks such as grading and delivering content. I believe this approach will have a particularly strong impact in Vietnam, where scalable, high-quality learning resources can help close gaps in access and educational quality.

## 5. If your friends or former employer were asked to comment on 3 good traits and 3 bad traits about you, what would they say and why?

### 3 Good Traits:

- **Self-learning and research** – Always proactive in exploring new knowledge, staying updated with technology trends, and experimenting with new ideas.

- **Quick adaptability** – Able to adjust work methods and roles flexibly based on project requirements.

- **Good collaboration** – Work effectively with teammates and willingly share knowledge to support others.

### 3 Bad Traits:

- **Inconsistent documentation habits** – Sometimes my documentation and process notes are not consistent, and I'm working to improve this for easier handovers and reuse.

- **Limited team leadership experience** – I have not had extensive opportunities to lead teams, but I'm actively learning and practicing leadership skills.

- **Taking on too many tasks** – I tend to accept multiple tasks at once, so I'm developing better prioritization and time allocation skills.

## 6. If you could buy a billboard anywhere around the world, what would it say and where would it be?

I'd place a billboard in front of major universities and tech hubs in Vietnam, and it would say:

> **"AI is the best teacher for the self-taught."**

AI has helped me learn so many things — without relying on YouTube or a mentor. If you know how to learn, AI can accelerate your growth more than you might imagine.

## 7. What do you believe is true, but can't prove?

I believe AI will develop its own form of creativity that humans can't fully comprehend. It won't just mimic human ideas but generate concepts, patterns, and solutions beyond our imagination.
